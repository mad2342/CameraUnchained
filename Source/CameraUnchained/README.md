# Camera Unchained

[Battletech Mod][ModTek] Suppress forced camera movements. Simple focus on relevant events without blocking players ability to control camera.

## Details
Even with all camera settings disabled the game still takes away control of camera on certain events:
- Sensor lock
- Powering up
- Standing up
- Death
- Melee

This mod prevents that and will (by default, configurable) replace these forced camera movements with a simple focus on the relevant position (without disabling control or randomly changing rotation).
